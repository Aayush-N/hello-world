Getting started with git
Hello world
I'm for the first time using Git (really!).

In the future if you read this, I wasn't that stupid but yeah, I didn't know how to use Git and am learning it know.

Anyone else reading this--Well, yeah I too learn't how to use git from the official guide. Also, it's not stupid to write a hello world document.

Peace!
